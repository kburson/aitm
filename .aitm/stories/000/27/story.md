# [Core C21] Shared local number allocation

**GitHub issue:** [kburson/aitm#27](https://github.com/kburson/aitm/issues/27) · **Parent:** [#2](../2/story.md) · **State:** Backlog.

**Review-procedure decision before implementation:** native XPR accepted the parent decomposition, but later rounds reused earlier full-file context with targeted rereads instead of the requested fresh full-file reread. The [published manifest](../2/plan/reviews/xpr-2026-11-09-core-plan/review-manifest.md) retains this limitation and the question of additional explicitly authorized full-file validation. No sixth round or policy waiver is implied.

## User story

As a developer delivering aitm-core, I want the bounded C21 capability and proof described below so the accepted core design can be delivered with auditable dependencies and acceptance evidence.

## Scope and estimate rationale

This is the 3.5 implementation agent-hour, P1/S leaf from the [accepted parent plan](../2/plan/core-implementation-plan.md#c21-shared-local-number-allocation), publication `55b94bbe77a19002ff077c122560cf185652d25c`. The estimate includes local verification and source-review engagement; it is not measured actuals or a calendar promise. S means this scoped deliverable is estimated at no more than four hours; P1 follows the core's foundational priority. Prerequisite interfaces and fixtures are reused as stated in the plan. At JIT, resplit/review if current evidence makes the cap implausible; expansion is not planned overflow.

**Blocked by:** [C22 / #26](../26/story.md), [C17 / #22](../22/story.md).

**Blocking:** [C28 / #37](../37/story.md), [C30 / #39](../39/story.md), [C64 / #58](../58/story.md), [C49 / #65](../65/story.md).

Dependencies include shared-file serialization, not only functional dependencies. A closed issue without delivered required interfaces is insufficient. This is an ordinary child, not an expansion. [Execution order and independent work](../2/plan/leaf-stories.md).

## Accepted decomposition excerpt

The exact parent-plan section follows. C-keys are stable plan identities; the actual issue dependencies are mapped above. The excerpt is parent decomposition evidence, not this leaf's own Design/Plan/JIT acceptance.

**Estimate:** 3.5 h · **Depends on:** C22, C17 · **Parent:** #2 · **Priority/size:** P1/S.

**Mandatory shared-file predecessors:** C17. These are included in Depends on and must be carried into the leaf issue graph.

**Touched files:** src/aitm_core/providers/local.py; src/aitm_core/services.py; src/aitm_core/cli/stories.py; packages/aitm-core/tests/integration/test_c21.py.

**Consumes:** delivered contracts from the listed dependencies (or no core prerequisite for C01). **Produces:** `graduate_local(intent: GraduationIntent, finalization: FinalizationIntent) -> GraduationResult; project_latest(publication, key) -> ActionResult`. Domain request/result records live with this producer and reference the shared typed contracts above.

- [ ] **Test first:** test_allocator_two_clones: real graduate invokes C22 build_graduation inside one candidate operation; inject failure after number proposal/before construction and assert no permanent ID, moved draft, usable numbered story or partial relationship/action exists. Local CAS atomically commits all surfaces; shared mode exposes ID only after verified publication. Two drafts race for one number, loser rebuilds complete transaction under same semantic intent; lost ACK observes result. Same draft exposes one ID; offline candidates stay unissued. Pass FinalizationIntent to C22 construction after choosing each candidate. Every losing-number retry re-runs materialize_finalization with the newly chosen child ID and fresh snapshot; never reuse a RelatedWriteSet containing the old candidate. No caller may expose a proposed number before the complete operation is authoritative.
- [ ] **Implement:** the named contract and its owned adapter within the stated paths; preserve every global constraint and failure distinction.
- [ ] **Verify and retain:** run `uv run --package aitm-core pytest packages/aitm-core/tests/integration/test_c21.py -q` to PASS plus affected contract suites and Ruff; complete source review/delivery evidence under the common cycle.

**Risk/boundary:** C21 implements the C13 LocalGraduationAuthority.graduate(intent, finalization) method by delegating to graduate_local, and wires it into the existing graduate adapter. Allocation is internal candidate construction, never a separately exposed durable local ID; externally issued pending identities retain their distinct C20/C22 semantics.

## JIT reminders and likely defects

Likely defects are the refusal, identity, timing, omission or recovery failures named in **Test first**; retain each corresponding negative assertion, not just the nominal path. Risk boundary: C21 implements the C13 LocalGraduationAuthority.graduate(intent, finalization) method by delegating to graduate_local, and wires it into the existing graduate adapter. Allocation is internal candidate construction, never a separately exposed durable local ID; externally issued pending identities retain their distinct C20/C22 semantics.

Pin current source and prerequisite delivery evidence before Develop. Keep the common plan verification/review/delivery cycle and exact touched-path ownership.

## Bootstrap provenance

Created from accepted epic decomposition under the owner's 2026-11-09 planning assignment. GitHub issue creation occurred at `2026-11-09T08:01:19Z`; this local record was written at `2026-11-09T08:17:42Z`. Events are explicitly manual bootstrap v0 records. No unavailable core command, runtime guard, leaf review, JIT, Develop clock or implementation delivery is claimed. The original epic Refine estimate remains unchanged.
